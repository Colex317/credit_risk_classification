The Credit Risk Classification assignment focused on using the Logical Regression Model, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report in supervised machine learning. Python and supervised learning were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that identified the creditworthiness of borrowers.
