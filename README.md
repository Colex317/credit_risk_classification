The Credit Risk Classification assignment focused on using the Logical Regression Model, Confusion Matrix, and Classification Report in supervised machine learning. Python and supervised learning were used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that identified the creditworthiness of borrowers.

# Conclusion
The analysis followed a structured machine learning process to build and evaluate a model for predicting borrowers' creditworthiness. By leveraging logistic regression and appropriate evaluation metrics, the model's performance was assessed, providing valuable insights for improving lending decisions and mitigating financial risk. This comprehensive approach ensures that the peer-to-peer lending services company can make better-informed decisions, ultimately reducing the likelihood of loan defaults.
